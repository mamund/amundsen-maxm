# Baseline Project Narrative: Amundsen's Maxim in Practice

Welcome! This project demonstrates how to build a clean, evolvable Web API using a layered design approach grounded in [Amundsen's Maxim](https://www.amundsens-maxim.com/).

## ðŸ§  What is Amundsenâ€™s Maxim?

> "Your data model is not your object model is not your resource model is not your message model."

This maxim reminds API designers and developers to keep clear **boundaries** between the internal parts of a system and the external contract it offers. You can read more at [amundsens-maxim.com](https://www.amundsens-maxim.com/).

## âœ… What's in the Baseline Project?

This project implements a simple **Todo List API** using Node.js and Express, structured in **four clean layers**:

| Layer     | Purpose                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `data`    | Reads/writes JSON records to the file system |
| `object`  | Shapes and validates internal object structure |
| `resource`| Implements the REST API routes (`/todos`)     |
| `message` | Encodes the response, including HAL-style `_links` and action metadata |

Each layer is:
- Independently testable
- Internally validated (input via code, output via JSON Schema)
- Fully decoupled from the others

## ðŸ”„ Why This Matters

Because of this clean separation, **we can safely change one layer without breaking the others**. For example:
- Change the database format (mod-db)
- Add computed fields or defaults (mod-object)
- Rearrange the resource paths (mod-resource)
- Switch message formats (mod-message)

To prove this, weâ€™ve included a small **automated test suite** you can run at any point to ensure everything still works:
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

You can also use the optional script:
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

## ðŸ§ª Projects in This Collection

This folder is just the **baseline**. In this series, youâ€™ll also find:

- `mod-db`: changing the file structure
- `mod-object`: modifying internal object rules
- `mod-resource`: altering how the API exposes data
- `mod-message`: switching response formats or hypermedia types

Each one runs independently and is built to show how the maxim helps preserve system integrity even as things change.

Thanks for exploring this project. The best way to appreciate Amundsenâ€™s Maxim is to **see it in action**, and thatâ€™s exactly what this series provides.
